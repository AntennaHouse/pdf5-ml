					<stentry>Task</stentry>
					<stentry>
						<p>The short description should explain what the task information helps
							users accomplish, the benefits of the task, or the purpose of the task.
							Do not simply repeat the title. Try to include information that will
							help users understand when the task is appropriate or why the task is
							necessary. Avoid stating the obvious, such as "You can use XYZ to do A"
							as the only statement in the short description for Task A. In some
							cases, add more information about why the task is beneficial.</p>
						<p>Do not use sentence fragments. Use complete sentences. Avoid starting
							short descriptions with phrases such as "This topic describes . . . ."
							or "This topic is about . . . ."</p>
					</stentry>
				</strow>
				<strow>
					<stentry>Concept</stentry>
					<stentry>
						<p>Introduce the concept and provide a concise answer to the question "What
							is this?" and in some cases "Why do I care about this?" If the concept
							is unfamiliar, you can start with a brief definition. Avoid using the
							short description to lead in or build up to a topic. The short
							description paragraph should contain the main point of the concept
							topic. The concept short description should clearly apply to a concept.
							Avoid turning the concept topic into a task.</p>
						<p>Do not simply repeat the title. Do not use sentence fragments. Use
							complete sentences. Avoid starting short descriptions with phrases such
							as "This topic describes . . . ." or "This topic is about . . . ." </p>
					</stentry>
				</strow>
				<strow>
					<stentry>Reference</stentry>
					<stentry>
						<p>Briefly describe what the reference item does, what it is, or what it is
							used for. In most cases, use a complete sentence.</p>
						<p>You can use a sentence fragment only for a topic that is very short, such
							as an API topic and each of its subtopics. Use consistent phrasing
							across libraries and information centers so that your information can be
							seamlessly integrated with another product's information.</p>
