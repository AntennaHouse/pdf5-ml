    <glossdef>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention 
        for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. 
        Aspects of the DOM (such as its "Elements") may be addressed and manipulated 
        within the syntax of the programming language in use. 
        The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API).</glossdef>
