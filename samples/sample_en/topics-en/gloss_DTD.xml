    <glossdef>Document Type Definition (DTD) is a set of markup declarations that define a document type for SGML-family markup languages (SGML, XML, HTML). 
              DTDs were a precursor to XML schema and have a similar function, although different capabilities.
              DTDs use a terse formal syntax that declares precisely which elements and references may appear where in the document of the particular type, 
              and what the elementsâ€™ contents and attributes are. DTDs also declare entities which may be used in the instance document.
              XML uses a subset of SGML DTD.
