    <glossdef>SAX (Simple API for XML) is an event-based sequential access parser API developed by the XML-DEV mailing list for XML documents. 
        SAX provides a mechanism for reading data from an XML document that is an alternative to that provided by the Document Object Model (DOM). 
        Where the DOM operates on the document as a whole, SAX parsers operate on each piece of the XML document sequentially.</glossdef>
