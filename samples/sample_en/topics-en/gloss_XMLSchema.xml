    <glossterm>XML Schema (W3C)</glossterm>
    <glossdef>XML Schema, published as a W3C recommendation in May 2001, is one of several XML schema languages. 
              It was the first separate schema language for XML to achieve Recommendation status by the W3C. 
              Because of confusion between XML Schema as a specific W3C specification, 
              and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general, 
              some parts of the user community referred to this language as WXS, an initialism for W3C XML Schema, 
              while others referred to it as XSD, an initialism for XML Schema Documentâ€”a document written in the XML Schema language, 
              typically containing the "xsd" XML namespace prefix and stored with the ".xsd" filename extension. 
              In Version 1.1 (currently in July 2011 a Candidate Recommendation), the W3C has chosen to adopt XSD as the preferred name, 
              and that is the name used in this article.</glossdef>
